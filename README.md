## Description ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Naereen/StrapDown.js.svg)
In order to facilitate the follow-up of patients' files in Morocco, the CNSS group launched a tender for the creation of a console application that will be exploited in all the network of CNSS agencies in Morocco. The MaCNSS application will allow CNSS agents to easily follow the reimbursement files of each patient who is registered with CNSS.
## Context Of The Project
-[x] Each CNSS agent has an account in the application, to access the application, he must enter the email + password with a verification code sent to his email box valid (5min)

-[x] When the patient arrives at the agency, he deposits his reimbursement file, which is composed of a CNSS form, this file is identified by the patient's matricule, thereafter each patient can join the barcode (if necessary) of each medication prescribed on the prescription.
-[x] The patient can also join the laboratory tests
-[x] The patient can also join a copy of the X-rays or scanner
-[x] The CNSS agent will manually check each document and then enter all the information on the MACNSS application,
-[x] The system will automatically indicate to the agent the amount of reimbursement of each document deposited by the patient.
-[x] Each document deposited by the patient is identified by a code
-[x] We have only one administrator in the system who will manage the accounts of the CNSS agents, he can add, modify

-[x] Each medication has a reimbursement rate set by the CNSS direction
-[x] There are medications that are not reimbursed by CNSS, in this case the patient can only have the reimbursement of a medical visit

-[x] At any time the patient can consult the history of his reimbursement files

-[x] The reimbursement file is either: pending, refused or validated
